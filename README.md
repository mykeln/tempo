tempo
=====
Tempo looks at historical workout data and extrapolates to determine future workouts. The goal is to achieve 90% of what a coach does. The inherent flaw: dynamically changing plans based on results.

philosophy
=====
each week is part of a "block," a 4-week period in tempo terminology. each week is manually named after the "essence" of the week of workouts. In other words, if I did mostly endurance rides during the week, but two tempo workouts, that'd be a "tempo week." These weeks change depending on which part of the block it is in, so they ladder up: tempoblock1, tempoblock2, tempoblock3, etc. At the end of each block in the off season, there is a test.

Each week, block, year has a pattern. I now have four years of solid workout history to work from. The goal is to look at this history and say, for example:
- it's week 43. three of the past four years, you were doing tempoblock3 at this point, so go ahead and do tempoblock3 this year, too"

challenges
=====
- if it's two-and-two, show both? Show one with the alternate, favoring the more recent years?
- storing the extrapolation, so i can continue to record not just the rides i did, but what i was prescribed

known issues
=====
- today's workout stuck with green background when "previous years" is toggled again
